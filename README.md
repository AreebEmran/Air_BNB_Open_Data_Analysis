“Introduction to Airbnb Open Data Analysis in R”


Welcome to our analysis of the Open Data Airbnb using R! In this project, we will strive to discover and analyze the Airbnb dataset and extract the salient points, trend analyses and patterns relations within the housing sector. The R programming language and its libraries will be harnessed to instill the readers with short-term rental properties, which can be an exciting experience.


Data Cleaning:

Ensuring accuracy & consistency, the data set will be cleaned before delving into data mining. Here, the handling of missing data, removing duplicates, adapting data formats, and efforts to identify and remove any anomalies that may affect our analysis, is one and the same.


Data Manipulation:

After the data has been prepared, we'll perform manipulations, which will allow us to gather significant information and come up with new metrics to help us in the analysis. This process typically involves data collection, stacking up, merging, screening, transforming variables to infer some intelligent conclusion.


Data Visualization:

Showing data is the cornerstone of experience-based learning and that is where the understanding of the patterns and trends is on the top of the list. We employ R's visualization libraries such as ggplot2 and ggmap to create thoughtful charts, graphics, and maps to show the above findings visually. We will learn how to build solid communication foundations, thus delivering our analysis to the audience in a way that is informative and captivating.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA is one of the primary elements in any forms of data analysis. During our data exploration we are going to discover connections between variables, look out for outliers and find any patterns in the data from Air BNB. This will include summary statistics and regression analysis as well as simple and distribution plots.


Text Analysis:

On top of the non-lingual data, Airbnb’s dataset may also incorporate textual data such as reviews, descriptions, and amenities. We'll conduct text analysis using the NLP techniques integrated in the model to process or extract information from the unstructured data. Generally, this would be classification by applying text sentiment, topic modeling, and word frequency analysis.
